# GPSProject

This repository contains the final commented submission for the ESS 5410 - Advanced Satellite Positioning term project.

Two different pieces of software have been included in this submission: 1) The RTKLIB ROS NODE and 2) The RTK Visualizer

These files can be found under the subdirectory:

ROSHAWK/src/ROS_RTKLIB_Bridge/src/

All other contents of this folder are necessary to operate the "ROSHAWK" package within the ROS environment and enable RTK
positioning on a robotic platform.
